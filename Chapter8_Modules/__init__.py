Imagine you wrote a program with 10,000 lines of code. If you put all of the code in one file, it would be difficult to
navigate. Every time there was an error or exception, you would have to scroll through 10,000 lines of code to find the
one line causing the problem. Programmers solve this issue by dividing large programs into multiple pieces, called
modules - another name for a Python file with code in it - containing each piece. Python allows you to use code from
one module in another module. Python also has built-in modules, modules that are built into Python and contain important
functionality.
