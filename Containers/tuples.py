"""
A tuple is a container that stores objects in a specific order. Unlike lists, tuples
are immutable, which means their contents cannot change. Once you create a tuple, you
cannot modify the value of any of the items in it, add new items to it, or remove
items from it. You represent tuples with parentheses. You must separate items in a
tuple with commas. There are two syntaxes to create a tuple:
"""

# my_tuple = tuple()
# print(my_tuple)

# And:

# my_tuple = ()
# print(my_tuple)

"""
To add objects to a tuple, create one with the second syntax with each item you want
to add, separating them with commas:
"""

rndm = ("M. Jackson", 1958, True)
print(rndm)
