Dictionaries are another built in container for storing objects. They are used to link one object,
called a key, to another object called the value. Linking one object to another is called mapping.
The result is a key-value pair. You add key-value pairs to a dictionary. You can then look up a key
in the dictionary and get its value. You cannot, however, use a value to look up a key.
"""

"""
Dictionaries are mutable, so you can add new key-value pairs to them. Unlike lists and tuples,
dictionaries do not store objects in a specific order. Their usefulness relies on the associations
formed between keys and values, and there are many situations where you need to store data in pairs.
For example, you could store information about someone in a dictionary. You could map a key called
height to a value representing the person's height, a key called eyecolor to a value representing
the person's eye color and a key called nationality to a value representing the person's
nationality.

Dictionaries are represented with curly brackets. There are two syntaxes for creating dictionaries:
"""

my_dict = dict()
print(my_dict)

# And:

my_dict = {}
