"""
Strings have a method called split, which you can use to separate one string into two or more strings. You pass the
split method a string as a parameter, and it uses that string to divide the original string into multiple strings.
For example, you can separate the string "I jumped over the puddle. It was 12 feet!" into two different strings by
passing the split method a period as a parameter.
"""

print("Hello.Yes!".split("."))

"""
The result is a list with two items in it: a string made up of all the characters before the period, and a string made
up of all the characters after the period.
