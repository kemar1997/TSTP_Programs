# Chapter 13. The Four Pillars of Object-Oriented Programming

"""
There are four main concepts in object-oriented programming: encapsulation,
abstraction, polymorphism, and inheritance. Together, they form the four pillars
of object-oriented programming. All four concepts must be present in a
programming language for it to be considered a fully object-oriented programming
language, like Python, Java, and Ruby. In this chapter, you will learn about
each of the four pillars of object-oriented programming.
