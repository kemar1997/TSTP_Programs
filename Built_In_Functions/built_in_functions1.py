"""
Python comes with a library of functions built into the programming language called
built-in functions. They perform all sorts of different computations and tasks and are
ready to use without any work on your part. len is another built-in function. It returns
the length of an object-for example, the length of a string(the number of characters in it):
"""


# len("Monty")

result = len("Monty")
print(result)
