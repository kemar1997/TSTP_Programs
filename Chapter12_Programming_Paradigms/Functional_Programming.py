"""
Functional programming originates from the lambda calculus: the smallest universal programming language
in the world (created by the mathematician Alonzo Church). Functional programming addresses the problems
that arise in procedural programming by eliminating global state. A functional programmer relies on
functions that do not use or change global state, the only state they  use are the parameters you pass
to a function. The result a function returns is usually passed on to another function. A functional
programmer can thus avoid global state by passing it from function to function. Eliminating global
state removes side effects and the problems that come with them.
