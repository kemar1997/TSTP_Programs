"""
While loop: a loop that executes code as long as an expression evaluates to True. The syntax for a while-loop is 
while [expression]: [code_to_execute], where [expression] represents the expression that determines whether or not the
loop will continue and [code_to_execute] represents the code the loop should execute as long as it does:
"""

# x = 10
# while x > 0:
#     print('{}'.format(x))
#     x -= 1
# print("Happy New Year!!")

"""
If you define a while-loop with an expression that always evalutes to True, your loop will fun forever. A loop that
never ends is called an infinite loop. Here is an example of an infinite loop:
"""

# while True:
#     print("Hello World!!")
