"""
You can use the built-in range function to create a sequence of integers, and use a for-loop to iterate through them.
The range function takes two parameters: a number where the sequence starts and a number where the sequence stops. The
sequence of integers returned by the range function includes the first parameter (the number to start at), but not the 
second parameter (the number to stop at). Here is an example of using the range function to create a sequence of 
numbers, and iterate through them:
"""

for i in range(1, 11):
    print(i)


"""
In this example, you used a for-loop to print each number in the iterable returned by the range function. Programmers
often name the variable used to iterate through a list of integers i.
